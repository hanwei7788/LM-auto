How to use config.json:
=======================

To generate graphs from all the data collected except processes (because
process data is generally much more amorphous than other sampled data),
simply add an entry to regular_graphs dictionary in config.json. Two
main kinds of graph entries are supported:
 - The list of subgraphs (such as mem_stats in config.json.example, which
   will generate five actual graphs from components of the memory stats in
   the report)

 - The main graph, depicted in the graph entry dictionary by using null as
   the value for the key; this will cause the entry sharing its name with
   the key to be taken straight from the report as the measurement value.
   It is OK to use this for measurements whose values itself are lists
   (such as cpu_usage, where the measurement is a list with 1 float per
   CPU core); all the list items will be plotted as separate curves on the
   same graph.

Processes are plotted slightly differently. The procs list in config.json
is a list of processes that will be screened from the process tree listing
in the report, and plotted.
