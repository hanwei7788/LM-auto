sufu recommended usage

1.) name the exported logfile according to the image

   $ mv -i log imx6-0.30-swa_system-prod-20170919-1133

   It's important that chronological order is reflected in alphabetic
   order of the files.

2.) split the log file into boot specific parts

   $ ./logsplitter.sh imx6-0.30-swa_system-prod-20170919-1133

3.) Analyze all boot specific logs in one go

   $ ls imx6-0.30-swa_system-prod-20170919-1133-boot-00* | xargs -L 1 ./sufu.sh

4.) if there were error messages about missing measurement points remove the
    affected output files

   $ rm imx6-0.30-swa_system-prod-20170919-1133-boot-0001.csv

5.) create a single csv file

   cat imx6-*.csv > all.csv

CSV format description

Output file format

Example

imx6-0.30-swa_system-prod-20170921-0355-boot-0002,uboot2kernel,445830,446,446,mount_root,4292558171,2409,1963,ui_cluster,4288642491,6325,3916,ui_center,4286274053,8693,2368

- first column (value) is the log file name the measurements where extracted from

- after that there are 4 columns (values) for each measurement point
-- measurement point name
-- raw value extracted from log (this is not currently used. It's just saved in case we
   might need to debug something in the measurement or reporting framework)
-- absolute timestamp of the measurement point converted to millisecons
-- relative timestamp of the current measurement point past the previous measurement point
   in milliseconds

Output print format

The sufu script also prints similar data. However, for better human
readability each measurement point is reported as a new line. Separate lines
would be more difficult to handle in a spreadsheet, so file format and print
format were chosen to be different.

Example (same as above)

imx6-0.30-swa_system-prod-20170921-0355-boot-0002,uboot2kernel,445830,446,446
imx6-0.30-swa_system-prod-20170921-0355-boot-0002,mount_root,4292558171,2409,1963
imx6-0.30-swa_system-prod-20170921-0355-boot-0002,ui_cluster,4288642491,6325,3916
imx6-0.30-swa_system-prod-20170921-0355-boot-0002,ui_center,4286274053,8693,2368

The idea of printing was to allow the user to quickly/early spot if there is
invalid/unreasonable data. Of course the issue would also become visible in
a chart later.
