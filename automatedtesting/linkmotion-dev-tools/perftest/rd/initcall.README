1) make sure initcall_debug is on kernel command line (should be the default
   in our R&D setup)

2.) boot

3.) save dmesg output to a file

    Example:

      # dmesg > /var/log/dmesg1.log

4.) transfer the log file to your PC

5.) run analysis script on PC

      Example:

      $ ./initcall.sh /tmp/dmesg1.log

    output is a list sorted by incall duration

    (Your could probably run the script on target with R&D image,
    but you would need to install gawk.rpm. Not tested.)

Note:

   The script seems to work equally well for syslog output
   (/var/log/messages). So by minimally modifying the kernel to just
   get initcall debug working this could be used in product images
   (with log export)
